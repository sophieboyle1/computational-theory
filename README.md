## Task 1: Binary Representations üîç

### **Overview**
In Task 1, I implemented four key functions to manipulate bits in a 32-bit unsigned integer. Bitwise operations are powerful tools often used in fields like cryptography, data compression, and algorithm optimization. While they can be tricky at first, mastering them provides a deeper understanding of how computers handle binary data.

The goal was to create functions that simulate operations commonly seen in cryptographic algorithms like SHA-256‚Äîrotating bits, making conditional choices, and computing majority values at the bit level.

### **Research and Insights**  

Bitwise operations are fundamental in **low-level computing**, used in **cryptography, data compression, networking, and graphics**. Since Python does not enforce fixed-width integers like C, **bit masking (`& 0xFFFFFFFF`)** is required to correctly simulate **32-bit unsigned integers**.

For Task 1, I implemented four key functions‚Äî**bitwise rotation (`rotl`, `rotr`), conditional selection (`ch`), and majority voting (`maj`)**‚Äîall of which play crucial roles in **cryptographic security and data manipulation**.

### üîê **Bitwise Operations in Cryptography**  

The functions in Task 1 are widely used in cryptographic hash functions like **SHA-256**, where bitwise operations ensure **diffusion** (spreading input bits widely) and **non-linearity** (making output unpredictable).  

- **`rotl(x, n)`, `rotr(x, n)`** ‚Äì Used in cryptographic rounds to efficiently mix bits.  
- **`ch(x, y, z)`** ‚Äì Selects bits based on conditions, adding complexity to hashing functions.  
- **`maj(x, y, z)`** ‚Äì Determines the majority bit at each position, ensuring unpredictable outputs.

### üöÄ **Real-World Applications Beyond Cryptography**  

Bitwise operations go far beyond cryptographic security and play a major role in:  

- **Data Compression** ‚Äì Algorithms like **Huffman coding** use bitwise packing to reduce storage.  
- **Networking & Protocols** ‚Äì TCP/IP headers store flags using bitwise masks for fast packet processing.  
- **Graphics & Image Processing** ‚Äì Extracting RGB channels from a pixel value using bitwise masking:  
  ```python
  red = (pixel_value >> 16) & 0xFF  # Extracts the red component

### **Functions Implemented**

1. **`rotl(x, n)` - Rotate Left**  
   Rotates the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer `x` to the left by `n` positions.  
   - Overflow bits wrap around to the rightmost positions.
   - Example: `rotl(0b0001, 2)` ‚Üí `0b0100`.

2. **`rotr(x, n)` - Rotate Right**  
   Rotates the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer `x` to the right by `n` positions.  
   - Overflow bits wrap around to the leftmost positions.
   - Example: `rotr(0b1000, 1)` ‚Üí `0b0100`.

3. **`ch(x, y, z)` - Choose Function**  
   The function conditionally selects bits based on the value of `x`.  
   - Where `x` has `1`s, it chooses the corresponding bits from `y`.  
   - Where `x` has `0`s, it chooses the corresponding bits from `z`.
   - Example: `ch(0b1010, 0b1111, 0b0000)` ‚Üí `0b1010`.

4. **`maj(x, y, z)` - Majority Function**  
   Determines the majority bit at each position among `x`, `y`, and `z`.  
   - If at least two of the inputs have `1`s at a given position, the output will have a `1`.
   - Example: `maj(0b1010, 0b1111, 0b0000)` ‚Üí `0b1010`.
