## 🔍 Task 1: Binary Representations and Bitwise Operations

### **Overview**
In Task 1, I implemented four key functions to manipulate bits in a 32-bit unsigned integer. Bitwise operations are powerful tools often used in fields like cryptography, data compression, and algorithm optimization. While they can be tricky at first, mastering them provides a deeper understanding of how computers handle binary data.

The goal was to create functions that simulate operations commonly seen in cryptographic algorithms like SHA-256—rotating bits, making conditional choices, and computing majority values at the bit level.

### **Functions Implemented**

1. **`rotl(x, n)` - Rotate Left**  
   Rotates the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer `x` to the left by `n` positions.  
   - Overflow bits wrap around to the rightmost positions.
   - Example: `rotl(0b0001, 2)` → `0b0100`.

2. **`rotr(x, n)` - Rotate Right**  
   Rotates the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer `x` to the right by `n` positions.  
   - Overflow bits wrap around to the leftmost positions.
   - Example: `rotr(0b1000, 1)` → `0b0100`.

3. **`ch(x, y, z)` - Choose Function**  
   The function conditionally selects bits based on the value of `x`.  
   - Where `x` has `1`s, it chooses the corresponding bits from `y`.  
   - Where `x` has `0`s, it chooses the corresponding bits from `z`.
   - Example: `ch(0b1010, 0b1111, 0b0000)` → `0b1010`.

4. **`maj(x, y, z)` - Majority Function**  
   Determines the majority bit at each position among `x`, `y`, and `z`.  
   - If at least two of the inputs have `1`s at a given position, the output will have a `1`.
   - Example: `maj(0b1010, 0b1111, 0b0000)` → `0b1010`.
