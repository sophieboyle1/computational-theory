## üîç Task 1: Binary Representations and Bitwise Operations

#### **Overview**
In Task 1, I implemented four key functions to manipulate bits in a 32-bit unsigned integer. Bitwise operations are powerful tools often used in fields like cryptography, data compression, and algorithm optimization. While they can be tricky at first, mastering them provides a deeper understanding of how computers handle binary data.

The goal was to create functions that simulate operations commonly seen in cryptographic algorithms like SHA-256‚Äîrotating bits, making conditional choices, and computing majority values at the bit level.
